Findings:
- The majority of survey respondents owned a home with a mortgage (308,958), and the fewest live without paying rent (8382) between December 29, 2021 and January 4, 2023.
- Across all homeownership statuses, feelings of anxiety are experienced more often than feelings of lonely, interest, and down.

- People who own their homes outright reported feeling less anxiety than others.
- People who both rent and live without paying rent experience the highest instances of anxiety.

- Anxiety level is higher for those who make less money, and this pattern is consistent between all income levels.
