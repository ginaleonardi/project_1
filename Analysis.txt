Introduction
The Household Pulse Survey is a 20-minute online survey, conducted by the Census Bureau, studying how the coronavirus pandemic and other emergent issues are impacting households across the country from a social and economic perspective.
We reviewed survey data from December 29, 2021- January 4, 2023.
Each survey has a 1-4 scale for frequency of anxiety, worry, depression and lack of interest; 4 being the highest. 
  1: Not at all
  2: Several days
  3: More than half of days
  4: Nearly every day

We found over the course of year anxiety frequency increased.
The highest average being closer to the holidays
The West region of the United States reported higher feelings of anxiety.
The Midwest reported the least.

Do people with kids have higher levels of anxiety?
There was a total of 509,655(70.91%) surveys reported no kids in the household and 209,098(29.09%) kids living at home between the ages of 0-17
We found that 65% people reported feeling anxious nearly everyday did not have any kids.
	
Does Homeownership impact feelings?
The majority of survey respondents owned a home with a mortgage (308,958), and the fewest live without paying rent (8382). "Rent free" is specified that no one in the home is paying rent, so this includes people experiencing homelessness.
Across all homeownership statuses, feelings of anxiety are experienced more often than feelings of lonely, interest, and down.
People who own their homes outright reported feeling anxiety less frequently than others.
People who both rent and live without paying rent experience the highest instances of anxiety.
